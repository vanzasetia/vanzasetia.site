# Personal Website of Vanza Setia

I write blog posts on my website. Before, I used to write in CodeNewbie.

My CodeNewbie profile â€” [Vanza Setia - CodeNewbie Community ðŸŒ±](https://community.codenewbie.org/vanzasetia)

You can find all my blog posts on the archive pageâ€”[Archive â€” Vanza Setia](https://vanzasetia.site/archive/).

All the links that I found useful to build this website is on [`./docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md).

## Technology

My website is using the following technology:

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- HTML
- CSS
- SVG
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Node.js
- WAI-ARIA

## Features

The website includes the following features:

- Homepage: A showcase of my latest projects and blog posts.
- Blog: A collection of my learning experiences.
- About: A brief introduction to my skills, my interests, and my experience.
- Webmention: A collection of interactions from Mastodon and other websites that support Webmention.

## Getting started

I use Node `v18` at the time I am writing this sectionâ€”02 April 2023. I do not know what might happen if you run this project on the Node that is below `v18`. To be safe, make sure you use Node `v18` or higher.

You should install all the `devDependencies` by executing:

```bash
npm install
```

After that, you can view the project on your localhost with:

```bash
npm run start
```

Then, you can build the project with:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can view the website at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Configuration and usage

You can configure everything. In this section, I tell you some of the things that you can configure.

### Commands

You can configure the `start` and `build` commands by looking at the Eleventy documentationâ€”[Command Line Usage â€” Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/).

The `clean` command is used to remove the `_site` and `_webmentioncache` folders. This can be useful if you have a duplication issue or you want to get a new and fresh build version. You can change the command by adding or removing more folders to delete. The full documentation is available on GitHubâ€”[isaacs/rimraf: A `rm -rf` util for nodejs](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf).

The `check-links` command is used to check internal navigation links such as the links inside the table of contents. You must run the `start` or the `build` command first before running this commandâ€”to generate the `_site` folder. The documentationâ€”[Check HTML links | Rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/tools/check-html-links/overview/).

### Metadata

You can change the metadata of the website by changing the [`./src/_data/metadata.js`](./src/_data/metadata.js) file.

The complete source code of the `<head>` tag is inside the [`./src/_includes/layouts/base.njk`](./src/_includes/layouts/base.njk).

## Deployment

I recommend using Netlifyâ€”I use this platform to host my website. There is already a `netlify.toml` file that will configure the build process.

## How to contribute

I do not need any contribution at the moment. But, I am open to any contribution. In other words, you can contribute to this project.

Here are the things that you need to do:

- Create a new issue before making any changes (we must discuss it first)
- Make sure your code-formatter does not change the format of the code base.
- Follow the format that is already available

## Acknowledgments

I created this website using Eleventy. Before I knew about it, I thought it would be very hard to maintain a static website with a lot of pages. Now, I manage to create my website and write blog posts. Thank you, Eleventy team!
