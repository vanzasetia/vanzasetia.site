I learned more about the `<blockquote>` element and found out that:

<blockquote class="flow">

Attribution for the quotation, if any, must be placed outside the blockquote element.

</blockquote>

â€” [HTML Standard #the-blockquote-element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element)

I usually put the attribution inside the `<blockquote>` element.
