## What is CAPTCHA?

CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart". Many websites use it to prevent bot spamming. CAPTCHAs provide challenges that can be done by humans.

CAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image or audio file.

Two common CAPTCHAs that I commonly find are reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha.

## Why does CAPTCHA exist?

According to Statista, bots accounted for 42.3% of worldwide Web traffic in 2021.

Bots can be used to spam, scrape information, and many other things. They can create issues for social media platforms. For example, they can do promotion by commenting on each person that posts something. They can be annoying for humans.

CAPTCHA solves this issue by making sure that humans are accessing the platform. It provides a challenge that only real humans can solve—although not all humans can solve it.

## How to bypass Captcha?

If you often deal with Captcha, you can try a CAPTCHA-solving service to automatically solve it for you.

A service that I want to talk about is 2Captcha.

## What is 2Captcha?

2Captcha is a program for solving Captcha automatically. All CAPTCHAs are solved by their workers, so it can bypass all human-readable types of CAPTCHAs.

## Closing

I already know CAPTCHA for a long time. I was not aware of its benefit. Now, I know that it is a useful thing. I also know that there is a service to solve CAPTCHA—I never thought about it before.
