## Delete Google

[Delete Google. "Don't be evil" has been retired.](https://deletegoogle.com/)

I can not delete my Google account.

I use Gmail for email. I use Google Drive as my cloud storage. Me and people around me use Google Meet. I use Google Play Store to install and update my applications. I use an Android phone which means I can not delete Google applications. So I depend on Google services.

But, I do things to minimize as much as possible my interactions with Google services.

- Search engine: The lite version of [DuckDuckGo](https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite)
- Email: Proton Mail
- Cloud storage: Proton Drive

Access all the Proton services — [Proton — Privacy by default](https://proton.me/)
