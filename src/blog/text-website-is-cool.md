I found [Thricegreat's Webpage](https://thricegreat.neocities.org/) when I was browsing on [No CSS Club](https://nocss.club/).

That webpage mostly contains posts with TXT files. Most of the posts are short.

I try using PageSpeed to test the performance of a TXT post. The result is surprising.

Take a look at yourself — [Result for https://thricegreat.neocities.org/maximize_your_power.txt - PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-thricegreat-neocities-org-maximize_your_power-txt/u0xchwiaw1?form_factor=mobile)

## Neocities

Thricegreat's Webpage is one of the incredible websites on Neocities.

Neocities has a collection of personal websites. Most of them are having nostalgic themes.

See the websites on Neocities — [Neocities - Browse](https://neocities.org/browse)

Websites on Neocities are refreshing to see because they are different. They do not have the same pattern as the websites that I see every day—typical layout such as a big text with a paragraph below it and then a call-to-action button, wait, that is the layout of my website.
