## What is Captcha?

CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart". Many websites use it to prevent bot spamming. CAPTCHAs provide challenges that can be done by humans.

CAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image or audio file.

Two common CAPTCHAs that I commonly find are reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha.

## Why does Captcha exist?

According to Statista, bots accounted for 42.3% of worldwide Web traffic in 2021.

Bots can be used to spam, scrape information, and many other things. They can create issues for social media platforms. For example, they can do promotion by commenting on each person that posts something. They can be annoying for humans.

Captcha solves this issue by making sure that humans are accessing the platform. It provides a challenge that only real humans can solve—although not all humans can solve it.

## How to bypass Captcha?

If you often deal with Captcha, you can try a Captcha solving service to automatically solve it for you.

A service that I want to talk about is 2Captcha.

## What is 2Captcha?

2Captcha is a program for solving Captcha automatically. All Captchas are solved by their workers, so it can bypass all human-readable types of Captchas.

It also allows you to be a Captcha solver. In other words, you can register yourself as a worker to solve Captchas. Then, you will be paid for doing it.

## My experience with 2Captcha

I signing-up myself as a user.

The first problem that I got was the password criterion.

{% image "./2captcha-password-criteria.png", "Alert: Field «Password» must use the Latin alphabet and contain at least 8 characters, one digit and one capital letter" %}

This password criterion is not good. I do not like it when it tells me I **must** use the Latin alphabet. I can not include symbols. Why? 2Captcha team, I recommend having simpler criteria; to must at least eight characters. This can make it easier for people to sign-up.

After that, I had to complete a Captcha. Then, I signed up.

Once, I signed up, I wanted to make sure that my account is secure by activating two-factor authentication (2FA). **2Captcha provides a 2FA method by One-Time Password (OTP)  authentication**. This is great.

I noticed that I could be a [customer](#dfn-customer), a [worker](#dfn-worker), and a [developer](#dfn-developer) even though I signed up as a user. I did not expect this.

Then, I tried to be a worker and started to work by visiting the "Worker cabinet" by clicking the "Start work" link—[Worker cabinet — 2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/cabinet).

At first, I needed to complete a training section. I had to solve 16 Captchas and got 35 seconds to solve each Captcha. If I made a mistake it allowed me to try solving the Captcha again.

Then, I tried doing the real work by solving Captchas. I solved four Captchas and earned 0.00104 US dollars.

Now, that will take a while. But, 2Captcha provides other ways to earn money. As a side note, you need to log in to see the examples. If you do not have an account or are not logged in, the links will take you to the login page.

- **Make a YouTube review**: You can see the existing videos—[YouTube review examples — 2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/partner/review-examples).
- **Write an article**: You can see some examples—[Article examples — 2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/partner/article-examples).
- **Put a banner on your website**: You can get the banners—[Banners — 2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/partner/banners).
- **Landing pages**: You can get your referral links once you have an account—[Landing pages — 2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/partner/landing-pages)
- **Integrate 2Captcha into the program**: For developers, you can earn 10% from users using software ID.

You can access this page to see the brief overview of the available affiliate programs — [Affiliate — 2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/affiliate).

I think it would be great if people can see those example pages without having to have an account.

## Closing

I already know Captcha for a long time. I was not aware of its benefit. Now, I know that it is a useful thing. I also know that there is a service to solve Captcha—I never thought about it before.

Captcha can be a way to protect a website from a bot. 2Captcha can help you solve Captchas and make money.
