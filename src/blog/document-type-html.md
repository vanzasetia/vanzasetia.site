## What is it?

`<!DOCTYPE html>` is an HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language, version 5) doctype declaration. It is the first line of code in an HTML document. It tells web browsers which version of HTML is being used and how to interpret the following code. In this case, it tells web browsers that it is an HTML version 5 document.

## Do you need to include it?

Yes, you must include it on every webpage.
