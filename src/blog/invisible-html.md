## What is "Invisible HTML"?

It is the code snippet that I covered starting from 01 June 2023 until 07 June 2023. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Invisible HTML</title>
  </head>
</html>
```

## A blog post for each line of code

I did not cover the closing tags because they are included with the associated opening tags.

- [Document Type HTML](/blog/document-type-html/)
- [The Root of an HTML Document](/blog/the-root-of-an-html-document/)
- [The Hidden Skull of the Website](/blog/the-hidden-skull-of-the-website/)
- [Meta Charset](/blog/meta-charset/)
- [X-UA Compatibility Meta Tag](/blog/x-ua-compatibility-meta-tag/)
- [Viewport Meta Tag](/blog/viewport-meta-tag/)
- [Title Tag](/blog/title-tag/)

## Fun facts

The HTML tutorials that I watched did not explain those lines of code. I wanted to know the reasons why I needed to include those nine lines of code. So I wrote those seven blog posts.

Another fun fact is at first, I wanted to make a blog post with "Invisible HTML" as the title that covers the nine lines of the code snippet.

Then, I wrote too much about each of them and lost the motivation to write the blog post.

After that, I decided to take a different approach which was to create a blog post for each line of code.

It worked!

I hope you find it useful.
