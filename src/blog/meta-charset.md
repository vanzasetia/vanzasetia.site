## What is it?

Meta charset is information that is used by browsers to show the characters on the website.

I do not know much about this.

When you use an Emmet shortcut by typing an exclamation mark, you will get `<meta charset="UTF-8">`.

The UTF-8 is used because it supports most of the languages on the earth and even emojis.

## Do you need to include it?

Yes, you can include it and make sure it is the first child element of the `<head>`.

If you do not include it, the browsers will automatically determine the character encoding.
