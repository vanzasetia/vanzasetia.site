**Use text whenever possible.** Text is the fastest thing to render.

**Avoid images whenever possible.** If you need to use images, make sure you optimize them by reducing the size of the image. [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) can help you to optimize your images.

**Avoid third-party code whenever possible.** In other words, the production code is 100% your code. Third-party may contain a lot of stuff that your website does not use.

**Avoid using frameworks.** You should start a project without a framework. Use a framework when you have reasons to do so. Do not use a framework because it is popular or because everyone is using it. Do not bring everyone to justify your choice.

**Avoid animations whenever possible.** Animations can cause lags on low-end devices. My device is a low-end device so when I visit a website that has a lot of animations, my browser will stop immediately.

If you want to go extreme:

- **Do not use JavaScript:** If your website needs JavaScript, make sure it is not broken without JavaScript. 
- **Tiny CSS:** Write as little CSS as possible. Keep your design as simple as possible. For personal websites, you can aim to have a stylesheet that is less than 30 Kilobytes (KB) uncompressed and non-minified size.
- **No images:** Images must not exist. They are the reasons why a website can have a heavy page weight.
- **No custom fonts:** Custom fonts can make your page weight bigger. So by not using them at all, you will have a light website.

The point is **less is more**. Less stuff on your website means more performance for your website.
