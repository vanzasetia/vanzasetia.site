Text is the fastest thing to be rendered on browsers. It loads faster than images. It also loads faster than videos.

Now, I want to talk about cover images or thumbnails. Usually, a blog post will have a cover image. The problem is the cover image has nothing to do with the blog. It consumes my cellular data for nothing.

I took a lot of time to create the cover images. I used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to design the cover images for [my blog posts on CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/vanzasetia). So, I used a lot of my time for something useless.

The text-only blog is good. It is easy to create. It is easier to be fully conformance with [WCAG version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) than any other type of blog. It is very fast to be rendered. It allows users on a slow connection to gain knowledge. It saves money, especially for people who are in expensive data plans. It is good in many ways.

## Inspiration

I got inspired to write this blog post after I read a blog post from Zain â€” [Why have I made this blog text-only ?](https://www.zainullah.com/why-have-i-made-this-blog-text-only/)
