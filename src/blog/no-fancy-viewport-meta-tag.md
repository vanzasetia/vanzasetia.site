Keep it simple.

You do not need to have a fancy meta viewport tag for your website.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

That is a good meta viewport tag. It works. It makes your website responsive. It allows users to zoom in and out on mobile browsers without having to enable force zoom.

The most important thing for any kind of website is the content. Not the meta viewport tag. So, create good content and keep your meta viewport simple.
