## Closing

I got the inspiration for making this from [Bob Monsour](https://www.bobmonsour.com/about) who creates The 11ty Bundle series. Then, I thought it would be cool to have the "Frontend Mentor" version.

If you want to be included or have suggestions, contact me through Frontend Mentor's Discord or [send me an email](mailto:venusbumi2@gmail.com). I do not put any conditions. Everyone in the Frontend Mentor community is welcome.
