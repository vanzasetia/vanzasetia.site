## Closing

I got the inspiration for making this from [Bob Monsour](https://www.bobmonsour.com/about) who creates The 11ty Bundle series.

Then, I thought it would be cool to have the "Frontend Mentor" version. This can be a way for the community members get more appreciation.

I might create a second bundle or just update this one. I do not know.

If you want to be included or have suggestions, contact me through Frontend Mentor's Discord or [send me an email](mailto:venusbumi2@gmail.com). I do not put any conditions. Everyone in the Frontend Mentor community is welcome.

I hope this can be a way to help people to get feedback on their solutions. I also hope this can be a way to appreciate community members who have spent their time giving feedback to help people.
