## What is it?

The `<title>` tag—not to be confused with the `title` attribute—is the following:

<blockquote class="flow">

The `<title>` HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab.

</blockquote>

— [`<title>`: The Document Title element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)

In short, it is used to give a title to your webpage.

## Do you need to include it?

Yes, you must include it.

If you do not include it the browsers will use the URL of the website.

Think of it like a name for a person. You can still call that person by specifically mentioning the unique appearance of that person. For example, "Hey, you are the one who uses a hat!". But, that is not convenient. It is better to call the name of that person. For example, "Hey, John!".
