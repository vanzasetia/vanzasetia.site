## Inspiration

I got the idea of writing this from the following question:

<blockquote class="flow">

Is running a personal website still that complex?

</blockquote>

— [Website complexities – Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/website-complexities)

I am still learning about web development. I am still considering myself new at coding. So I still remember how much it cost to have a personal website.

## Foundation

I need to know and understand English. Programming languages use English. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript use English. Not only that, most learning resources are written in English. So I must know and understand English.

As a side note, English is not my first language. I am Indonesian. That is why I consider it.

Next, I need to have a desktop. I can create my website on an Android device. But, I think having a desktop will make things easier. Also, it is the right place and what most people do.

I need to have an internet connection. This is important.

I need a physical space to write code.

I need the basic needs as a human. This is very important—even more important than an internet connection.

## Knowledge

I need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without paying for any courses. I learned them from video tutorials on YouTube. Then, I learned about them by reading blog posts, watching conference talks on YouTube, and building projects at [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

I did all those things without paying any money to any platforms. But, those things took a lot of time—and money for me to keep alive. It took me two years.

Now, I am still learning JavaScript. I am also still learning HTML, CSS, and **web accessibility**.

Hmm, web accessibility is something I did not expect to learn when I started learning about web development. I knew about it after I joined Frontend Mentor.

After I learned more about web accessibility, I realized that it should be considered whenever I wrote my code. I should consider it all the time. I need to write HTML with accessibility in mind. I need to write CSS with accessibility in mind. I need to write JavaScript with accessibility in mind.

Web accessibility took a long time to learn. I think it is a never-ending thing to learn.

That is the surface. My learning journey is not that linear. I was getting into "tutorial hell" which means I can not build anything without tutorials. Luckily, I managed to escape from it.

Anyway, the point is I need a lot of time to learn front-end web development.

(I just remember about Git. But, you already get the point. I do not need to keep rambling.)

## Accounts

I need to have a GitHub account. I need to have a Netlify account. I need a lot of accounts.

I do not think learning web development without making a single account is possible.

Account registration needs an email address. I need to have an email. I need to provide a lot of personal data.

When I wanted to buy a new domain name, **again**, I have to create an account.

Lots of accounts!

I think having a personal website without having to create an account is impossible. 

I can minimize the number of accounts by running things on my own. But, that will require technical knowledge such as setting up a server. I do not know.

## Content

A personal website needs something. I need to have something on my website.

This can take a very short time if I only have a heading level one with my name as the text. But, I think that would not be useful.

I learned more about English. I learned how to write clearly. I learned how to write things as simple as possible.

That learning process took a lot of time. Even after years of learning English, my writing is still (blank).

Anyway, I am still learning English.

## More

There are more things. I can not remember every single thing. So that is my answer to the "How much does it cost to have a website?"

My answer to "Is running a personal website still that complex?" is "Yes, it is still complex". I can use Wordpress, but that still requires me to learn about Wordpress—then create a new account.

I think the hardest thing to do is to find good resources, especially for self-taught developers like me. 

When I began learning in web development, I did not know where to start. I did not know the next thing to learn. I did not know whether I already did the right thing or not. Lots of question marks on top of my head. Now, there are even more question marks.

As time passed, I start knowing the "good places" where I want to learn something. For example, for web accessibility, I can go to [The A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) website.

Hmm, I just remember that I also learned how to search for things on the internet. But, I need to stop here.
