## What is it?

`<html>` element is the root element of the HTML page. It is the absolute parent element of the `<head>` and `<body>` elements.

## Do you need to include it?

Yes, you must include it with the `lang` attribute—`<html lang="en">`.

You must add a `lang` attribute to tell web browsers and translation API the language of your website. Also, to have your website compliant with **3.1.1 Language of Page** criterion from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1.

For example, you must use `lang="en"` if your website is written in English. Another example is you must use `lang="es"` if your website is written in Spanish.
