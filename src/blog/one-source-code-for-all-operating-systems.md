A website only needs one source code to be available on all browsers and operating systems.

Applications may not be available on some operating systems. But, websites are automatically available everywhere.

A simple HTML code will work everywhere. The web developer does not need to worry whether it will be working on Linux or Windows. They do not even need to think about it.

A website also does not require a specific version of Windows or Android. A website will degrade gracefully. An application requires a minimum version of an operating system. Otherwise, the application will not be working. So a website has better compatibility compared to an application.

Progressive enhancement makes websites work on old browsers. Also, progressive enhancement makes websites have different layouts or designs. The best experience is to use the latest version of a browser. But, if the users do not have it, they will still have a good experience.

Website is amazing.
