## History

When I first started this project on March 11, 2023, I just wanted to try the idea of having my own blog. It turned out that I was getting more serious about it. Then I decided to to make it as good as possible with HTML and CSS.

After that I tried to use Eleventy. I started playing with it for a day. I tried creating an RSS feed. I tried moving all my blog posts from CodeNewbie to this websiteâ€”luckily I don't have many blog posts.

After spending three days creating this website, I decided to put it on the internet.

## Design

I am not a designer. But, I try my best to make sure that this website is not looking very bad.

### Font family

I use the Noto Sans font family for the body text and headings. For the logo, I use the Miriam Libre font family.

For the Noto Sans font family, I use the regular and bold font weights. For the other one, I use the bold font weight. Those are the custom fonts that I use for this website.

You can find them on the Google Fonts website.

- [Noto Sans - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans)
- [Miriam Libre - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Miriam+Libre)

For the code snippet, I use the browser's default monospace font family.

### Colors

I use black and white colors. I like dark mode. So I decided to make the black as the background color and white as the text color.

Here are the list of the colors that I use:

- Background color: `#222`
- Text color and border color: `#eee`
- `<code>`'s background color: `#444`

I also provide a light mode version for this website. Here is the list of the colors:

- Background color: `#eee`
- Text color and border color: `#222`
- `<code>`'s background color: `#ccc`
