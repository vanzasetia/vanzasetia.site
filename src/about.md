Over the past two years, I have done the following:

- Developed over 30 responsive websites with accessibility in mind
- Gave 1300+ code reviews and discovered that 83% of them were helpful
- Got as much feedback as possible from the expert at Frontend Mentor
- Worked on a local community's website to fix accessibility issues

I am interested in:

- Web accessibility
- Responsive design
- Progressive enhancement
- Web performance

I love applying my skills to help companies create a website that can be accessed by different types of users and tools. As a result, the company's website will have more engagement and rank higher in search results.

*December 2022 - Jan 2023*

I was working as a web developer to fix five accessibility issues on a WordPress site.

- Increased the color contrast of the links inside the footer
- Added a missing heading
- Made the headings in a logical order
- Created another webpage to provide alternative text for an image that has much text on it
- Changed the website's language to the correct languageâ€”switched from "en-US" to "id"

The website that I was fixing: [Keuskupan Tanjungkarang - Situs Resmi Keuskupan Tanjungkarang](https://keuskupantanjungkarang.org/)
