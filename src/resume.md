## Volunteer

*December 2022 - Jan 2023*

I was working as a web developer to fix five accessibility issues on a WordPress site.

- Increased the color contrast of the links inside the footer
- Added a missing heading
- Made the headings in a logical order
- Created another webpage to provide alternative text for an image that has much text on it
- Changed the website's language to the correct languageâ€”switched from "en-US" to "id"

The website that I was fixing: [Keuskupan Tanjungkarang - Situs Resmi Keuskupan Tanjungkarang](https://keuskupantanjungkarang.org/)
